Life is a gift. Every moment of it is meant for striving towards excellence. Everything 
around us vibrates with our positivity. A halo of energy i.e.  creative energy surrounds us.
Having humane goals one should always move towards a positive resurgence. Tribulations and
trials check us at every phase but like  the Hercules we can achieve the impossible with our
resilience and determination. A different world awaits those who dare to dream. We have with
us a rich legacy pouring from the heaven's brink;to unfold ourselves into individuals with
potential. It is our moral duty.So let us all pledge to create a new world order that
transcends the ordinary and takes us to the sublime.I hope this website will give reflection
of our efforts in preparing a committed generation.
    Our institution believes in Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. 
Training sessions are arranged for teachers for their overall grooming.There is also an 
evaluation process conducted every month. Ms. Manasi added, “Special prizes, initiatives will
be given to the teachers every month.”Speaking about hiring good teachers, Ms. Manasi said,
“Yes, it was a tough challenge to find out the teachers who were really interested in good
teaching which inspires the students and leaves a long lasting impact on student’s mind.
I never wanted to recruit teachers who choose this profession just for time-pass or for money
making etc. Ms. Manasi said, “Parents – Teachers miscommunication, report book remarks, 
behavioural problems of the students, slow learners  problems, teacher’s ego issues and 
internal conflict, management’s problems, managing finance are the problems faced by us while
running the school.”She added, “We have to deal with the students as well as the parents with
patience, arrange meetings with both the parties,categorize the problems, sequence them 
priority wise, and discuss them individually with the people affected so it becomes easy to handle
the problems.”
